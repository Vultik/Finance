# Financier

This is an application created for Jetbrains Pychamps Hackathon.
Financier is a web application which helps the user to keep track of his or her financial goals, all at one place. It gives the option to the user to enter the investment amount and period of investment and returns how much saving should be made per month to achieve the goal within the stipulated time. On entering the user's monthly expenditure, an estimate is given whether or not the investment is on track. If off track, the extra amount which is needed to bring back the investment on track is 
also given.
